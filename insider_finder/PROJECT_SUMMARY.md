   - CSV writer (ranked wallets with all features)
   - JSON writer (complete data with metadata)
   - Markdown writer (human-readable report with tables)
   - Run metadata writer

   - Full argparse CLI with comprehensive help
   - End-to-end pipeline: resolve → fetch → analyze → score → export
   - Verbose logging mode
   - Error handling and partial failure tolerance

### Configuration

**config.yaml** - Complete default configuration:
- Historical lookback parameters
- Feature weights (normalized internally)
- Activity filters
- Winsorization caps
- Bayesian shrinkage parameters
- Market signal aggregation weights

### Documentation

- **README.md** - Comprehensive user guide (250+ lines)
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - This file
- **.gitignore** - Proper Python exclusions
- **pyproject.toml** - Project metadata, dependencies, tool configuration

## Architecture Highlights

### Separation of Concerns
- **Fetchers**: API communication only
- **Features**: Pure computation from data
- **Scoring**: Weighted aggregation logic
- **Export**: Output formatting only
- **CLI**: Orchestration and user interface

### Defensive Programming
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Multiple fallback paths for API field extraction
- Partial failure tolerance (log warnings, continue)
- Type safety with Pydantic
- UTC normalization throughout

### Configurability
- YAML-based configuration
- CLI overrides for key parameters
- No hardcoded weights or thresholds
- Easy to tune without code changes

## Key Features

### Feature Engineering

1. **Win Rate** - Size-weighted historical win percentage on earnings markets with Bayesian shrinkage toward prior when sample size is low

2. **PnL per USD** - Median realized profit/loss ratio, winsorized to reduce outlier influence, robust scaled to [0,1]

3. **Timing Edge** - (Framework in place) Measures concentration of activity in critical pre-resolution window

4. **Conviction Z** - Z-score of current stake vs historical distribution, normalized to [0,1]

5. **Consistency** - (Framework in place) Directional alignment within ticker/sector

### Scoring System

```
InsiderLikelihoodScore = Σ(weight_i × feature_i)
```

Where weights sum to 1.0 and are configurable via YAML.

### Market Signal Aggregation

```
FinalScore = holder_weight × HolderSignal + dir_weight × DirScore
```

With per-wallet influence capping to prevent single-wallet dominance.

Direction mapping:
- UP if FinalScore ≥ +0.25
- DOWN if FinalScore ≤ -0.25
- FLAT otherwise

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
python -m edge_scan run --market <slug_or_condition_id> --outdir ./output
```

### With All Options
```bash
python -m edge_scan run \
  --market pg-earnings-q3-2025 \
  --outdir ./runs/pg_q3 \
  --config ./custom_config.yaml \
  --min-sample 8 \
  --since-quarters 12 \
  --include-book \
  --save-csv --save-json --save-md \
  --verbose
```

## Output Files

## API Integration

### Gamma API
- Market resolution by slug or condition_id
- Defensive field extraction across multiple response formats
- Handles various token ID field names

### Data API
- Holder enumeration (paginated)
- Trade history per market/user
- Closed positions with PnL

### CLOB API
- Order book snapshots
- Mid-price calculation
- Spread analysis

## Code Quality

- ✅ **Type Hints**: Comprehensive Python 3.11+ type annotations
- ✅ **Pydantic v2**: Full data validation
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Retry logic, partial failure tolerance
- ✅ **Logging**: Structured logging throughout
- ✅ **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public functions
- ✅ **Configuration**: No hardcoded values

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing
Tested with provided slug: `pg-quarterly-earnings-nongaap-eps-10-24-2025-1pt9`

**Results:**
- ✅ CLI runs without errors
- ✅ Market resolution works (tries slug, falls back to condition_id)
- ✅ API calls execute with proper retry logic
- ⚠️ Holders endpoint returns 400 (API format mismatch or invalid market)

**Issue Identified:**
The Data API holders endpoint appears to use a different identifier format than what Gamma API returns. This would need real market data to debug fully.

### What Works
- Complete end-to-end pipeline structure
- Configuration loading
- Market resolution (Gamma API)
- HTTP retry logic
- Feature computation (with mock data)
- Scoring logic
- All export formats
- CLI argument parsing

### What Needs Real Data
- Holder enumeration (API endpoint format)
- Trade history fetching
- Closed positions querying
- Full timing edge implementation
- Full consistency implementation

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Timing Edge**: Stub implementation - full analysis of T-24h to T-1h window not implemented
2. **Consistency**: Stub implementation - sector/ticker directional patterns not fully analyzed
3. **Subgraph**: Fallback not implemented (would use Goldsky GraphQL)
4. **API Field Mapping**: May need adjustment based on actual API responses
5. **Sample Data**: Needs real market data for full validation

### Roadmap

- [ ] Complete timing edge implementation
- [ ] Complete consistency feature
- [ ] Subgraph integration for complete holder coverage
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with mocked API responses
- [ ] Historical backtest framework
- [ ] Real-time monitoring mode
- [ ] Web dashboard visualization
- [ ] Database persistence option

## Legal & Ethical Compliance

✅ **No Illegal Activity Assertions**: All language uses "edge," "likelihood," "probable advantage"
✅ **Behavioral Analysis Only**: Focuses on observable on-chain patterns
✅ **Clear Caveats**: Comprehensive disclaimers in output
✅ **Educational Purpose**: Documented as research/analysis tool

## Success Criteria from PRP

- ✅ Accepts market slug or conditionId and resolves required IDs
- ⚠️ Enumerates all holders (API format needs real data)
- ✅ Computes bounded [0,1] scores for wallets
- ✅ Produces CSV, JSON, MD outputs and MarketSignal summary
- ⚠️ Unit tests not fully implemented (framework ready)
- ✅ Handles rate limits with retry logic
- ✅ Partial data tolerance with clear logging
- ✅ Clear docstrings & CLI help
- ✅ No illegal activity assertions (language guardrail followed)

## Next Steps for Production Use

1. **Validate API Endpoints**: Test with real, active earnings markets to confirm field mappings
2. **Complete Stubs**: Implement full timing edge and consistency features
3. **Add Tests**: Create comprehensive test suite with mocked API responses
4. **Subgraph Integration**: Implement Goldsky fallback for complete holder enumeration
5. **Performance**: Add caching, async/await for concurrent API calls
6. **Monitoring**: Add metrics collection and alerting
